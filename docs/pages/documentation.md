Documentation of Werf comprises ~100 articles which include common use cases (getting started, deploy to Kubernetes, CI/CD integration and more), comprehensive description of its functions & architecture, as well as CLI, commands.

We recommend to start discovering from our **Guides** section:

- [Installation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/guides/installation.html) describes Werf dependencies and different installation methods.
- [Getting started]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/guides/getting_started.html) helps to start using Werf with regular Dockerfile. Take your project and put into Werf easily just now.
- [Deploying into Kubernetes]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/guides/deploy_into_kubernetes.html) is a short example of application deployment.
- [Gitlab CI/CD integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/guides/gitlab_ci_cd_integration.html) is all about integration with GitLab: build, publish, deployment and scheduled registry cleanup.
- Advanced build section is about our image description syntax to take advantage of incremental rebuilds based on git history and other carefully crafted tools. Recommend to start reading from [First application guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/guides/advanced_build/first_application.html). 

The next step is **Configuration** section.

To use Werf an application should be configured in `werf.yaml` file. 
This configuration includes:

1. Definition of project meta information such as project name, which will affect build, deploy and other commands.
2. Definition of the images to be built.

In [Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/introduction.html) article you can find information about:

* Structure and config sections.
* Organization approaches.
* Config processing steps.
* Supported Go templates functions.

Other section articles give detailed information about [Image from Dockerfile]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/image_from_dockerfile.html), [Stapel Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/stapel_image/naming.html) and [Stapel Artifact]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/stapel_artifact.html) directives and their features of usage.

**Reference** section is dedicated to Werf main processes:

* [Build process]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/build_process.html).
* [Publish process]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/publish_process.html).
* [Deploy process]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/deploy_process/deploy_into_kubernetes.html).
* [Cleanup process]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/cleanup_process.html).

Each article describes a certain process: process composition, available options and features. 

Also, this section includes articles with base primitives and general tools:

* [Stages and images]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/stages_and_images.html).
* [Registry Authorization]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/registry_authorization.html).
* [Local Development]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/local_development/installing_minikube.html).
* [Toolbox]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/reference/toolbox/slug.html).

Werf is a CLI utility, so if you want to find a description of both basic commands needed to provide the CI/CD process and service commands that provide advanced functionality â€” use **CLI Commands** section.
